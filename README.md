Salve, I'm Davide, call me Dawwo ðŸŒˆ!

At the moment I'm a university student working to get a degree and work in game development in the future! 
For now I mainly work on uni projects and very small personal ones but if occasion arises I don't let an opportunity go to waste.

Currently studying at University of Trento to get a degree in "Computer engineering, communication and Elecronics".

"So many ideas, so many projects. Yet so little time and so little energy... It's agony..."
